# Statesman
Statesman is a Generic Workflow Service. 

# Local setup
```
git clone <statesman>
cd statesman
CODE=$(pwd)
mvn clean package 
cd statesman-server/
```

Change the line on Dockerfile (in the path $CODE/statesman-server/Dockerfile): 

ADD config/docker.yml docker.yml

To the following for local:

ADD config/local.yml config/docker.yml
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up 
```
^This might fail for the first time as maria db is getting setup and statesman will not be able to load it in time initially. Can try again after the first run fails and it should work

Incase you have ports conflicting (8080, 8081, 8090, 34407, 35508 will be used by this app), ports are mentioned in the following files:
```
$CODE/statesman-server/Dockerfile 
$CODE/statesman-server/config/local.yml
$CODE/statesman-server/docker-compose.yml
```
